## What is it?
### Oh, just an algorithm that transforms images into ASCII illustrations...

## How do I use it?
### Well, it only works locally for now, so you'd have to download it and run it yourself until I figure out how to get it to work with remote server uploads or something. Still a noob.

## What's next?!
### Randomizing letters, and beefing up the UI so you can apply colors and options to your illustration. Even decide how 'sensitive' the algorithm is to dark and light shades. I want to go all out eventually.

## Can I help?
### Ya. If you want. Hit me up!
